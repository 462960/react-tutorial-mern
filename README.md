# React Tutorial using MERN stack
Build a complete React app, step-by-step with the MERN stack

## Introduction
This is a tutorial to get started with React, using the MERN stack. You will
not only learn React, but also associated environment and complimentary tools
such as Mongo, Express, gulp etc.

The complete step-by-step instructions will be available on [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com)
in a story titled React Tutorial using MERN stack. I will update the actual link
here once I am done publishing that story.

## 1. Hello World

### 1.1 index.html as a file
Create index.html as a file, use all scripts (react, react-dom, babel) from CDN.
Write a Hello World element within the HTML between `<script>` tags.

### 1.2 Serve it up
Use Node and Express to serve the HTML file.

## 2. Organize
Transform the JSX into JS at build-time rather than at run-time.

### 2.1 Split HTML and JSX
Split JSX and HTML into separate files.
